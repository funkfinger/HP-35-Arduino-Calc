# hp-mcu-calc

An Arduino library that is an HP-35 emulator. The bulk of this code comes from an Instructables project where [enurdag](https://www.instructables.com/member/enurdag/) created an Arduino-based HP-35 emulator: https://www.instructables.com/HP-35-Scientific-Calculator-Emulator-With-Arduino-/

If you have an Adafruit MacroPad RP2040 and want to see it working, you can check out [this project](https://github.com/funkfinger/adafruit-macropad-hp-35-calc).
